VoteSmart is a platform that simplifies and personalizes complex political content to empower voters by translating confusing propositions and policies into clear, unbiased insights. The project was built using React for a responsive frontend and FastAPI with MongoDB for secure user authentication and data management, while incorporating web scraping and the Gemini API to break down political language. Our largest challenges were Git merge conflicts and frontendâ€“backend integration, but we successfully implemented secure signup and personalized feeds, and we have plans to extend the platform with a voter-specific chatbot and real-time polling features.
